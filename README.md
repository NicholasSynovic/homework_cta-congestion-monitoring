## About

Traffic congestion can be monitored and predicted using algorithms. Existing
implementations include Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze. These applications
rely on aggregating the locations of their users as well as user reporting to
make predictions regarding traffic congestion.

There are currently no applications (to the authors' knowledge) that provide
traffic congestion monitoring of public services in the United States. To
address this, we are providing an open platform for traffic algorithms to be
applied to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) L trains.

We are limiting the scope of the application to the CTA L due to its:

- Well supported and documented API,
- Breadth and depth of information, and
- To set a reasonable and achievable goal
